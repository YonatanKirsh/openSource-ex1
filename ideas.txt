1. deck of cards: instead of each card game needing it's own app created form zero, 
we'll create a deck of cards so that developers can easily add new games (by defining the rules
of new games). just like a real deck of cards - you dont by a different deck for each game - so too
you'll only ned one platform for all virtual card games.

2. calculator: we'll define the platform (buttons etc.) and the basic mathematical operations that we learned how a computer can preform.
we'll allow the capability to add buttons that will define new mathematical operations, and the developers will obviously need to define how to perform
the operation.
this way we can create a platform that will eventually contain as many operations as possible - 
even though we only know how to execute a few basic operations.

3. new software language: create a new coding language, that will be comletely open source. this way developers can 
suggest changes that come up in their day-to-day use - and the language will be relevant for as many developers as possible.
